    <h1>Coconut Shrimp</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These coconut shrimp are rolled in a coconut beer batter before frying. Serve warm with your favorite dipping sauce â€” I use orange marmalade, mustard, and horseradish mixed to taste for a dipping sauce.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 Cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>2/3 Cup beer</li>
        <li>1 Large Egg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Teaspoons Baking Powder</li>
        <li>2 Cups Flaked Coconut</li>
        <li>24 Medium Raw Shrimp</li>
        <li>3 Cups Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with wax paper; set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk together 1/2 cup flour, beer, egg, and baking powder in a medium bowl until smooth. Place coconut and remaining 1/4 cup flour in 2 separate bowls.</li>
        <li>One at a time, hold shrimp by the tail and dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in beer batter; allow excess to drip off. Roll in coconut, then place on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry shrimp in hot oil, turning once, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Use tongs to remove shrimp to paper towels to drain.</li>
    </ol>
